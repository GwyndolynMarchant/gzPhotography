# Compatibility
- Fill flash may not work correctly with mods which modify the default weapons.
- The camera will not be accessible or functional with mods which entirely disable weapons. (ex: ) In these cases, the universal hotkey should still function.
- Screen clearing is done by translating the screen 42069 screen units down-right, so if there's anything else being drawn in that corner it will be revealed.
- Although the photography mod itself works on all preconfigured screen resolutions, some options menu text will be cut off at resolutions below 1024 horizontal pixels
- Fill Flash requires lights.pk3 to be loaded
